#### Project Overview:
This project analyzes the Indian Parliamentary Elections 2024 using SQL to derive insights from five CSV datasets. The focus is on understanding how different political parties and alliances performed in the election across all states and constituencies.

#### Datasets:
1. **constituencywise_details.csv**: Contains detailed information on candidates and votes (EVM and postal).
2. **constituencywise_results.csv**: Records constituency results, including winning candidates and margins.
3. **statewise_result.csv**: Lists state-level results, including Parliament Constituency and State.
4. **partywise_result.csv**: Details the performance of each political party across constituencies.
5. **state.csv**: Provides state-level mapping for results analysis.

#### SQL-Based Features:
- **Total Seats Analysis**: Query to identify total seats available for elections and seats won by political parties across states.
- **Alliance Performance**: SQL-based analysis of how alliances (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., and Others) fared in different states and constituencies.
- **Candidate Performance**: Extract candidate details, vote count, and margin of victory for deeper insights into competitive constituencies.
- **Vote Type Analysis**: Evaluate the distribution between EVM and postal votes for understanding voting patterns.

#### How to Run:
1. Import the five CSV datasets into MySQL Workbench.
2. Execute the provided SQL queries to generate insights for electoral performance, party analysis, and vote distributions.
3. Queries have been optimized for readability and performance.
